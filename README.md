## StemmaStudy

StemmaStudy was a side project that enabled the creation of "Connected Flashcards" viewable as a network complete with spaced repetition reviews (SM2+ algorithm) and assessments with a visualization of the results showing areas of the network needing improvement.

This iteration of the project has been abandoned in favor of new ideas. In its current state, it is not a compelling *product*. Though, I do think this constitutes a genuine improvement on the flashcard model. For instance, the task of creating a network of flashcards aids in the creation of flashcards better suited for spaced repetition. One naturally disperses information across the nodes rather than making big information-hogging flashcards, which is very easy to do, otherwise. In addition, the act of creating a network of these flashcards is exactly the sort of "summaritive", cognitively engaging desirable difficulty necessary for rich learning. 

Before I abandoned it, I did get a couple of good opinions from cognitive scientists:

> *I have never seen any other platform that does what StemmaStudy does in using flashcards in an organized way that will permit students to develop a schema for the material.*
>
> Henry L. Roediger III, coauthor of *Make It Stick*, Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis

> *From the perspective of helping people learn, this seems like a great way to do it. I've seen a lot of smart flashcard apps and this is the first time I remember seeing one where you can map out the relationships between topics/cards . . . the process of creating those mappings should be quite useful.*

> Nate Kornell, Professor of Psychology, Chair of Cognitive Science Program at Williams College

I have a few related ideas to take this further and, I think, transform these ideas into a much more compelling system. But, that'll be round 2!
